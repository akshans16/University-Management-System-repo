# 🏫 University Management System

A Java-based desktop application to manage university operations such as student records, faculty details, and academic data.  
This project demonstrates core Java concepts along with database connectivity and UI development.

## ✨ Features

- Manage student information  
- Manage faculty records  
- Store and retrieve academic results  
- View course-wise student details  
- User-friendly desktop interface  

## 🔨 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **UI:** Swing, AWT  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Connectivity:** JDBC  
- **Concepts Used:** OOP, Modular Programming, Data Handling  

## 🧩 Project Structure

- Modular Java classes for better code organization  
- Separate layers for UI, logic, and database operations  
- JDBC used for database communication  

## 🏃‍➡️ How It Works

1. User interacts with the Swing-based UI  
2. Input data is processed using Java logic  
3. Data is stored and retrieved from MySQL using JDBC  
4. Results are displayed back on the UI
